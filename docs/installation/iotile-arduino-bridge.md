# Arduino IDE Setup

If you have never used an Arduino, it is recommended you read the [Arduino Mega 2560 Getting Started](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoMega2560). 
and the many available tutorials. Just make sure you select **Arduino Mega 2560** when selecting which Arduino you have. 
The **Arduino Mega 2560** in the **PODuino** is just a regular Arduino, and can be used on its own like any other Arduino.

Otherwise, make sure you have the [latest Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

You need to install the IOTileBridge library (you can find the latest version as a GitHub release).

If you're using the PODuino, go to the Arduino IDE, choose Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .zip Library and select the IOTileBridgeMega.zip
folder downloaded from [here](https://github.com/iotile/poduino/tree/master/downloads)
